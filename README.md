CollarDB
========

What is CollarDB?
----------------
CollarDB is a fork of OpenCollar started at 3.6 when the Database and Web Remote features were removed.  Since that time it has had several bugs and features added.


What is here?
-------------
Currently the code is being broken down into to *Collar* and *Updater*.  This is intentional as the Updater Scripts can be used for more than just updating the Collar.  In the future you will see Cuffs, Addons, etc. added to the source tree.


Where is the Server Code?
------------------------
I will not be releasing my backend server code at this time.
